# Security Configuration

## Cloud SQL Database Security

### Current Configuration
- **Public IP**: Disabled (`ipv4Enabled: false`)
- **Private IP**: `10.35.0.3` (PRIVATE) - Only accessible via VPC connector
- **Network Access**: Private network only through VPC connector
- **Authorized Networks**: None (not applicable with private IP only)

### Security Benefits
- ✅ **Reduced Attack Surface**: No external internet access to database
- ✅ **Private Network Only**: Database only accessible via VPC connector
- ✅ **Better Security Posture**: Meets Cloud SQL security best practices
- ✅ **Compliance Ready**: Suitable for production environments

### Connection Method
The MCP server connects to the Cloud SQL instance using:
- **VPC Connector**: `default-connector`
- **Private IP**: `10.35.0.3:5432`
- **Authentication**: Database credentials (username/password)

### Testing
- ✅ **Health Check**: `database_connected: True`
- ✅ **Status Logging**: Successfully logging to database
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: Confirmed with Log ID: 10

## MCP Server Security

### Environment Variables
- Database credentials stored as Cloud Run environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Private IP configuration via environment variables

### Network Security
- Service runs in Cloud Run with VPC connector
- Database access restricted to private network
- No public database endpoints

## Best Practices Implemented
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Database only accessible via VPC
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of network security
3. **Private by Default**: No public IPs unless absolutely necessary
4. **Secure Communication**: All database traffic over private network
